### Overview

Machines can be taught to interpret and analyze images the same way our brains do. 
Image Processing involves manipulation of an image that amplify the same to generate information out of it.
The main goals of Image Processing is to represent processed data in a visual way, 
improve the processed image quality and classify objects in the image. 

**Methodologies**

* <ins>Analog Image Processing</ins>: used for processing photographs, printouts, and other image hard copies.

* <ins>Digital Image Processing</ins>: used for manipulating digital images with the help of complex algorithms

### This Repo

In this repository I added a collection of jupyter notebooks with 
examples of Image Augmentation, Prediction and Recognition using 
**TensorFlow**.

**It contains**

- `data` data sets used in the models
- `notebooks` jupyter notebooks with image processing examples 


*This collection of Jupyter Notebooks came from my own studies and trainings I have done during the past years. They are all updated to be used with `Python 3.7`.*
